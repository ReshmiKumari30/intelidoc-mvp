# IntelliDoc MVP

IntelliDoc is a simple, context-aware conversational AI assistant that helps users extract and query information from PDF or image-based documents. It reads your file, understands your question, and gives a relevant answer based on document content.

## Features
- Upload PDFs or scanned images
- Extracts text using OCR or PDF parsing
- Splits content and ranks relevant parts using semantic embeddings
- Answers questions using a local transformer-based question-answering model
- Clean and simple web interface built with Streamlit
